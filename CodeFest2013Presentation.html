				<p>Responsive Web components are an evolution on the concept of responsive Web design. The idea is to make the components that make up a Web site themselves responsive instead of just the site as a whole.</p>
				<p>You can think of responsive Web design as a top-down approach, and responsive Web components as a bottom-up approach, to solving the problem of making Web sites usable on a wide variety of devices.</p>
				<p>Responsive Web components are built on capability-detection and container-level media queries. This makes them more re-usable and adaptable.</p>
