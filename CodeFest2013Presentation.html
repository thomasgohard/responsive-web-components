<section>
	<p>The idea is to make the components that make up a Web site responsive instead of just the site as a whole.</p>
	<p>It's a bottom-up approach to be combined with the traditional top-down approach to responsive Web design.</p>
	<p>It depends on:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>feature-detection to identify the capabilities of the user agent, and</li>
		<li>container-level media queries to identify the space available to render the component.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Making the components themselves responsive makes them more re-usable and adaptable and makes the Web sites that use them more robust.</p>
