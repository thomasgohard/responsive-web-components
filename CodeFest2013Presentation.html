	<h2>Responsive Web components are…</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>A new approach to responsive Web design. The idea is to make the components that make up a Web site themselves responsive instead of just the site as a whole.</li>
		<li>A bottom-up approach intended to be combined with the traditional top-down approach to responsive Web design.</li>
		<li>Built on capability-detection and container-level media queries. This makes them more re-usable and adaptable.</li>
